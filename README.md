# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To build this, I run `npm run build` inside /c/dev/create-react-app/einsteins-problem/

I then click and drag the build output onto the netlify UI https://imgur.com/a/4HgYDKR
